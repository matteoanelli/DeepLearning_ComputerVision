# DeepLearning_ComputerVision

## Description of the Project
The project consists of building a traffic sign classifier, the first assignment is meant to create the classifier using a Feed Forward Neural Network. The second one introduce the Convolutional Neural Network and finally, the last one is testing the concept of Transfer Learning.
